# material-icons

## Why?


I prefer all my assets provided by bower so I decided to host it here and make it downloadable with bower. I know that there are already `bower`ed icon-fonts, but I just want the icon-font files, no svg, png etc. and I want it to work with `material-design-lite` as well.


## Getting started

### Install with bower

First you need bower, [see their site](http://bower.io/) for details 

```
bower install --save mi
```


### How to use

Place a link to `mi` in your header, it should look something like this.

```html
<link rel="import" href="bower_components/mi/material-icons.css">
```

### Example:

```html
<i class="material-icons">favorite</i>
```
